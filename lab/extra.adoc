Here are some ideas for next steps.

### Try OpenShift Source-to-image feature.

OpenShift allows you to get an Source code and transform it in a container image. This is very useful for people who don't know how to create your own image. OpenShift automatically detects the language and uses an appropriate "builder" to convert that in a functional container image. Actually the following languages are supported: Ruby, JavaEE, NodeJS, PHP, Pytho and Perl.

Let's see how it works using the link:https://github.com/yanaga/workshop-openshift-rbc/tree/master/frontend[frontend sources] as an example:

First, let's delete the existing frontend *Route*, *Service* and *ReplicaSet*

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *oc delete deployment,svc,route frontend-ui*
deployment "frontend-ui" deleted
service "frontend-ui" deleted
route "frontend-ui" deleted

$ *oc new-app --name=frontend-ui \
      https://github.com/yanaga/workshop-openshift-rbc \
      --strategy=source  --context-dir=frontend*
--> Found image 0b37bce (5 weeks old) in image stream "openshift/nodejs" under tag "4" for "nodejs"

    Node.js 4
    ---------
    Platform for building and running Node.js 4 applications

    Tags: builder, nodejs, nodejs4

    * The source repository appears to match: nodejs
    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/yanaga/workshop-openshift-rbc will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream "frontend-ui:latest"
      * Use 'start-build' to trigger a new build
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "frontend-ui"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "frontend-ui"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "frontend-ui"

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream "frontend-ui" created
    buildconfig "frontend-ui" created
    deploymentconfig "frontend-ui" created
    service "frontend-ui" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/frontend-ui' to track its progress.
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

This will trigger the build inside OpenShift. You can explore it using the following commands:

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *oc get builds*
NAME            TYPE      FROM          STATUS    STARTED              DURATION
frontend-ui-1   Source    Git@e09f71e   Running   About a minute ago   1m23s

$ *oc logs -f bc/frontend-ui*
----

You can also see the build happening in the OpenShift console:

image::images/build.png[Build,float="center",align="center"]

Don't forget to expose the *Route* and try the application. Do you remember how to it, right?

#### Building a new version.

When OpenShift is installed in a public address, you can enable link:https://developer.github.com/webhooks/[Github webhooks] that triggers a new OpenShift build each commit. This is useful for Continuous Integration environments. You can read more about it in the following link:https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/builds.html#webhook-triggers[guide].

You can also trigger a new build using *oc start-build <buildname>* command. It allows you to specify different location for the sources. Try it yourself! Clone the repository or make a local change and run the command.

Some examples that you can try.

NOTE: To build from local, you should be in the root path of the kubernetes lab (kubernetes-lab) because you already specified the --context-dir=frontend parameter.

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ cd lab/
$ *oc start-build frontend-ui \
          --from-dir=. \
          --follow*
Uploading directory "." as binary input for the build ...
frontend-ui-?
----

You can also build from Github sources

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *oc start-build frontend-ui \
         --git-repository=https://github.com/yanaga/workshop-openshift-rbc \
         --follow*
frontend-ui-?

### Try some microservices

link:https://developers.redhat.com/[Red Hat Developers] has worked intensively to integrate different opensource technologies and create a showcase of how cloud-native apps can interact in a microservices architecture: The link:https://github.com/redhat-helloworld-msa/helloworld-msa[Helloworld-MSA] playground!

This distinct demo allows developers execute some “helloworld” microservices, built using different technologies, and explore the following features:

- Different implementations: link:http://wildfly-swarm.io/[WildFly Swarm], Spring Boot, link:http://vertx.io/[Vert.X] and link:https://nodejs.org/en/[NodeJS].
- 3 invocation patterns: Browser as a client, link:http://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html[API-Gateway], Chained invocation;
- link:http://microservices.io/patterns/service-registry.html[Service-registry], Self-healing, Load-balancing  and link:http://blog.christianposta.com/deploy/blue-green-deployments-a-b-testing-and-canary-releases/[Blue/Green deployments] – Provided by link:https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift];
