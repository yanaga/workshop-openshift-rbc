### A console to manage your OpenShift applications
Duration: 10:00

Until now we have been using OpenShift CLI (_oc_) to manage our cluster. Wouldn't it be good if we could visualize/manage our cluster in a user/interface?

Let's take a look in OpenShift console.

Access https://openshift-master.g1.rbcexpo.com/

[NOTE]
====
Login with the credentials (username/password) provided in the paper that you received. Please contact one of the instructors if you didn't receive the paper with your credentials.

Please don't share your credentials with your colleague. You will be deploying a lot of different artifacts in your project, and the name of the artifacts must be unique within each project. Ask you colleague to get another paper from one of the instructors with different credentials.
====

Click on your *OpenShift project* and now you will see all OpenShift objects that you have created with oc command.

Take some minutes to explore this interface.

- Click on the Service and Deployment links and see the details.
- Click on the POD number and see the list of PODS. Select one POD to explore.
- Explore the POD details and the other tabs (Environment, Logs, Terminal and Events)
- In the right top corner, click in the gray _Actions_ button and check that you can also edit the YAML file.

NOTE: The blue bars on top of the pods are "Label filters" that were applied to select just the specific pods for the *ReplicationController* that you clicked.

Back to the *Overview* page and check that you can scale up and scale down the number of the pods simply by clicking on the gray arrows on the right hand side of the pods number.
