### Deploy Microservices
Duration: 5:00

As mentioned before, the application makes use of two other microservices:

- the Guestbook service (that writes to the MySQL database)
- a Hello World service

Both services are containers whose images contain self-executing JAR files. The sources are available in the zip file if you are interested in seeing it.

When deploying these microservices instances, we want to make sure that:

* We can scale the number of instances once deployed.
* If any of the instances becomes unhealthy and/or fails, we want to make sure they are restarted automatically.

Let’s deploy the microservices one at a time:

First, deploy the Hello World:

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *oc create -f helloworldservice-deployment.yaml -f helloworldservice-service.yaml*
deployment "helloworld-service-vertx" created
service "helloworld-service-vertx" created
----

Once created, you can see the replicas with:

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *oc get deployments*
NAME                       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
frontend-ui                2         2         2            2           12m
helloworld-service-vertx   2         2         2            2           22s
mysql                      1         1         1            1           3m
----

You can see the pods running:

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *oc get pods*
NAME                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
frontend-ui-1bvcv                1/1       Running   0          2h
frontend-ui-5vtsp                1/1       Running   0          2h
helloworld-service-vertx-prnhv   1/1       Running   0          4m
helloworld-service-vertx-sgds6   1/1       Running   0          4m
mysql-xvi3c                      1/1       Running   0          1h
----

You can also look at each pod’s log output by running:

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *oc logs -f helloworld-service-vertx-?????*
Aug 02, 2016 5:38:11 AM io.vertx.core.impl.launcher.commands.VertxIsolatedDeployer
INFO: Succeeded in deploying verticle
----
*Note:* The _-f_ flag tails the log.  To stop tailing, press _Ctrl+C_.

Our descriptor file specified 2 replicas. So, if you delete one of the pods (and now you only have 1 replica rather than 2), the ReplicaSet will notice that and start another pod for you to meet the configured 2 replicas specification. Let's try it!

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *oc delete pod helloworld-service-vertx-?????*
pod "helloworld-service-vertx-????" deleted
----

You should see that the pod was deleted, and the ReplicaSet will ensure a second instance is started. Sometimes this goes by very fast - and you'll notice that the pod you deleted is no longer there, and another pod, with a different name, was started.

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
[vagrant@rhel-cdk kubernetes]$ *oc get pods*
NAME                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
...
helloworld-service-vertx-ezuq3   1/1       Running   0          1m
helloworld-service-vertx-sgds6   1/1       Running   0          10m
...
----

Lastly, let’s create the Guestbook Service ReplicatSet and Service too!

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *oc create -f guestbookservice-deployment.yaml -f guestbookservice-service.yaml*
deployment "guestbook-service" created
service "guestbook-service" created
----
